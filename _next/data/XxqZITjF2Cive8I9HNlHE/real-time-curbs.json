We develop a methodology to \n        capture these real-time dynamics that can be deployed at scale for entire cities, revealing the complexities and nuances of street use. \n        <br/>\n        We equipped buses with a scanner that collected more than 800,000 real-time images of Parisian streets over \n        five weeks and used computer vision techniques to process these images and classify them depending on how \n        space was being used. Our model can recognize up to 30 categories of human activity and transportation, from people \n        walking or standing to distinguish between cars, vans, and other modes of transportation."},"diagrams":{"intro":{"subtitle":"Ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci","body":"Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, \n        sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt. \n        Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit."},"drawings":[{"url":"diagrams/CASE_diagrams-03.svg","label":"Camera Module","details":"The device to capture images every approximately 3 seconds of the external surroundings of the bus. \n                This allows the device to gather data without requiring any intervention by the bus operator. \n                The device processes the images locally without saving any images, allowing us to construct rich metrics on street use \n                without storing images and respecting individual privacy. \n                "}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
